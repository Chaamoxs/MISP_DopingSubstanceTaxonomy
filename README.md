# MISP_DopingSubstanceTaxonomy

This project aims to gather information about all the prohibited sports Doping Substances. 

We collected all of the information on the [WADA website](https://www.wada-ama.org/en/prohibited-list).

To do that we have created a python script to scrap this website and generate a JSON file (Taxonomy).

This Taxonomy could be add in MISP to help sports organizations to fight against usage of doping substances.
